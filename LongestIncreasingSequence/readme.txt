An implementation of a simple programming puzzle I was recently asked:

Given an array of integers, find and return the longest sequence of increasing elements.
E.g. [1, 2, 5, 10, 3, 4, 20, 30, 50, 2] -> [3, 4, 20, 30, 50]
In the case of a tie, return the first sequence found.

I'm sure there are more elegant or efficient solutions, but this is what I came up with on the spot.
